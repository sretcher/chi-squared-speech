## One Sample Chi-Squared Test
A study was conducted to learn about the effects of irrelevant speech on memorization (*Acoustical Science and Technology* Vol. 35, 2014). 71 subjects performed a memorization task under two conditions-with irrelevant background speech or silence. For each subject, the RDER (error between the two conditions as a percentage) was recorded. We will be using a one sample chi-squared test to see if the true standard deviation of the RDER measurements differs from 60 percent.

### Assumptions For Large Sample Chi-Squared Test
1. A random sample is selected from the target population.
2. The population is normally distributed.

We will assume that the assumptions have been fulfilled for this problem.

### Formulating Hypotheses

Since the chi-squared test is used primarily for inferences about a population variance, we will need to to write our hypotheses in terms of population variance. 

Ho: σ^2 = 3600

Ha: σ^2 != 3600
